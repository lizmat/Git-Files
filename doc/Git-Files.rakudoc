=head1 NAME

Git::Files - List known files of a git repository

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>

use Git::Files;

.say for git-files;          # current directory

.say for git-files <lib t>;  # "lib" and "t" dirs from current dir

.say for git-files :non-existing-also;  # also non-existing files

.say for git-files "/path/to/git/repo";      # all files in git repo
.say for git-files "/path/to/git/repo/dir";  # files in dir in git repo

=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Git::Files> distribution exports a single subroutine C<git-files>
which takes zero or more paths, and returns a C<Slip> of paths (as
strings) of all the files that are known to Git in the specified paths.

If no paths are specified, will assume the current directory.

Since it is possible that Git still knows about files that have been
deleted, but not yet committed, returned paths may not actually exist.
These will not be returned, unless the C<:non-existing-also> named
argument is specified with a true value.

=head1 SCRIPTS

The C<Git::Files> distribution also installs a C<git-ls> script for
convenience, to allow access to the same functionality from the
command line.
